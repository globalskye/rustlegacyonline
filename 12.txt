PayGate.to - Payment Gateway with Instant Payouts, Instant Approval, No Sign Up, No Rolling Reserve: High-Risk Merchant Account
This publicily available API provided by PayGate.to allows you to generate payment links anonymously without KYC. You can accept Credit/debit card (including MasterCard, Visa, and Maestro) – Apple Pay – Google Pay – SEPA or ACH local bank transfer. You will receive instant payouts to your USDC (Polygon) wallet address once the customer pay using the link. For more information visit: https://paygate.to/instant-payment-gateway/

For successful payment link generation you need to make two mandatory steps:

Generate a temporary encrypted wallet address using GET wallet.php by passing a unique callback URL + your own USDC (Polygon) wallet address to receive payouts. Optionally you can use the affiliate.php wallet creator and pass an additional wallet you own to earn affiliate percentage commission on every sale.

Redirect the customer to the payment page by passing the generated encrypted wallet address along with other required parameters through another GET request to Process Payment This rquest will directly send the customer to the payment page.

Please consult minimum order values for payment providers. Optionally you can white-label this API and use your own custom domain.

GET
Create Wallet
https://api.paygate.to/control/wallet.php?address=0xF977814e90dA44bFA03b6295A0616a897441aceC&callback=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.example.com%2Forders.php%3Fnumber%3D8271468415326
This endpoint retrieves wallet control information by making an HTTP GET request to the specified URL. The request includes the wallet address and a callback URL. The response returns a status code of 200, along with the encrypted receiving wallet address and callback URL in the JSON format.

Request Parameters
address: The wallet address to receive instant payouts after customer payment. Wallet must be a valid USDC (Polygon).

callback: urlencoded callback URL where the payment confirmation will be sent using GET request. You must have at least one unique GET parameter with each request. If you use the same parameter value again the same temporary receiving address will be provided in the response. In production use your own unique callback NOT example.com

Response
The response returns a newly generated encrypted receiving temporary wallet address and the same provided callback URL for confirmation in the JSON format. You may need to json_decode(); the response address_in to pass it in the next step.

address_in : This is the encrypted wallet address that need to be passed to the payment link generator (Process Payment) in the second step.

polygon_address_in : This is the generated receiving address decrypted for easy payment tracking. You can't pass this address directly to the second step, you need to pass the encrypted address_in.

callback_url : This is the same callback URL you passed containing all your parameters returned in a decoded format for confirmation. Our bot will send a GET request to this URL when the customer complete the payment containing all your parameters with an additional parameter value_coin representing the actual USDC value sent by the payment provider which can be useful for your system in case you want to verify the sent amount.

ipn_token: This token is useful when provided to our support team we will be able to track your payment and investigate failed callback events.

provider: Possible values can be fetched from provider id at provider status endpoint. Other providers can be available exclusively through the Multi-provider mode only.

email: urlencoded customer email address

currency: Currency code, for example: USD or EUR or CAD

Affiliate System
The affiliate system works the same way as the standard integration but it would allow sending and distributing the payout to multiple wallets. This would be controlled at the encrypted wallet creation step (address_in).

There are multiple possible setups for the affiliate system:

Follow the easy custom domain guide to fully integrate the system with or without affiliate commission. Using this easy method you can set your own custom set commission, rebranding the payment gateway with minimal coding skills.

Use this API server side to earn the default 0.5% or any custom set commission as you wish. (Payouts will be distributed to two wallets one is the merchant and the other is for the affiliate who rebranded the system).

Use this API server side to create an advanced integration with both sub-merchants and sub-affiliates. So you would have merchants using your system and affiliates under you doing marketing to the rebranded payment gateway.

In all use cases it is instant approval and instant payouts for all. The generated receiving wallets will automatically send payouts per the set API commission percentage. Make sure the merchant wallets and affiliate wallets are different otherwise requests will fail.
